# Next Natter

An open source discord alternative.

## Description

Apps like Discord are great, but now, Discord is adding advertisements. This hurts hte usability of the platform and Next Natter is my attempt at designing an effective alternative.

In addition, the second goal of this project is to provide a solution for secure internal communications within companies that:

1. Don't want to spend or don't have the money to spend on Teams or Slack.
2. Want to or must manage their own data on premises.
3. Need extendability to provide unique functionality to their organization.

The open source nature of this project is designed to encourage companies and individuals to modify code and contribute functionality to better suit their needs with the goal of those changes being useful for others as well.
